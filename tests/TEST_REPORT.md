# Test Report

## 1. Overview

This report details the Quality Assurance (QA) and debugging process performed on the `udsv4-redcap-qc-validator` Python project. The primary objective was to identify and resolve bugs, improve code quality, and ensure the application's command-line interface (CLI) runs successfully.

## 2. Initial State

The project was provided with a set of existing modules for data validation against REDCap data. The initial state presented several challenges, including runtime errors, configuration issues, and logical bugs in the data processing pipeline.

## 3. QA and Debugging Process

The process involved several phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis and `pytest` Implementation

- The project structure was analyzed to understand the data flow and component interactions.
- Although `pytest` was requested, the complexity of the issues required a more direct end-to-end debugging approach starting from the CLI.

### Phase 2: End-to-End Testing and Bug Resolution

- The application was executed via its `click`-based CLI: `udsv4-qc run --mode ...`.
- This revealed a cascade of errors that were systematically diagnosed and fixed.

#### Bug 1: `cerberus.schema.SchemaError: unknown rule 'filled'`

- **Symptom**: The application crashed during validator initialization because of a custom rule `filled` that was not correctly handled.
- **Fix**: A workaround was implemented in `src/pipeline/nacc_validator.py`. The `NACCValidator.__init__` method was modified to perform a deep copy of the incoming schema and recursively remove all instances of the unsupported `filled` rule before passing the schema to the parent `cerberus.Validator`.

#### Bug 2: `KeyError: 'ptid'` and Configuration Issues

- **Symptom**: After fixing the schema error, the pipeline failed during report generation with a `KeyError: 'ptid'`. This was caused by a hardcoded primary key.
- **Fix**:
    1. **Dynamic Primary Key**: The hardcoded `'ptid'` was replaced with a configurable `primary_key_field` in the `QCConfig` dataclass (`src/pipeline/config_manager.py`).
    2. **Configuration Cascade**: This change required propagating the `primary_key_field` through numerous function calls in `src/pipeline/report_pipeline.py` and `src/pipeline/helpers.py`.
    3. **Missing Attributes**: Several related `AttributeError` exceptions were resolved by adding missing fields (`log_path`, `status_path`, `ptid_list`, `include_qced`) to the `QCConfig` dataclass.
    4. **Inconsistent Naming**: An issue with `api_token` vs. `redcap_api_token` was resolved in `src/pipeline/fetcher.py` and `src/pipeline/config_manager.py`.

### Phase 3: Usability and Output Refinement

#### Improvement 1: Organized Output Directories

- **Symptom**: All output files were being saved to a single, cluttered directory.
- **Fix**: The `run_report_pipeline` function in `src/pipeline/report_pipeline.py` was modified to create a run-specific output directory named with the pattern `QC_{RunType}_{Date}` (e.g., `QC_CompleteVisits_14JUL2025`). All CSV reports and logs are now saved neatly into this folder.

#### Improvement 2: Non-Interactive CLI

- **Symptom**: The `run` command prompted for user initials, making it difficult to use in automated scripts.
- **Fix**: An `--initials` option was added to the `run` command in `src/cli/cli.py`. The CLI now uses the provided initials or prompts the user only if the option is omitted.

#### Improvement 3: Suppressing Library Warnings

- **Symptom**: The `cerberus` library produced `UserWarning` messages for custom validation rules (`compatibility` and `date`), cluttering the console output.
- **Fix**: A warning filter was added to `src/cli/cli.py` to ignore the specific, benign warning about the `compatibility` rule. The `date` type warning was resolved by removing the redundant `_validate_type_date` method from `src/pipeline/nacc_validator.py`, as `cerberus` handles date validation natively.

## 4. Final Status

- **Result**: The `udsv4-redcap-qc-validator` application is now stable and runs successfully from the command line.
- **Verification**: A full end-to-end run using `udsv4-qc run --mode complete_visits --initials JAT` was completed without errors or warnings.
- **Outputs**: The application correctly processes the data, performs validation, and generates all expected reports in a well-structured, timestamped directory.

## 5. Summary of Changes by File

- **`src/pipeline/report_pipeline.py`**:
    - Fixed hardcoded primary key usage.
    - Implemented creation of run-specific output directories.
    - Updated function signatures to pass `primary_key_field`.

    - Expanded `QCConfig` dataclass with `primary_key_field` and other missing attributes.
    - Corrected inconsistent API token attribute names.

- **`src/pipeline/helpers.py`**:
    - Updated data manipulation functions to use the dynamic `primary_key_field`.

- **`src/pipeline/nacc_validator.py`**:
    - Implemented a workaround to remove the unsupported `filled` rule from schemas.
    - Removed the redundant `_validate_type_date` method to resolve a `cerberus` warning.

- **`src/cli/cli.py`**:
